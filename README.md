LiteRAG is a memory-efficient document retrieval system built for scenarios where resources are limited. Unlike traditional RAG systems requiring 4-8GB RAM, LiteRAG delivers 74% recall using only 512MB heap space through optimized BM25 lexical search, along with some custom scoring.
Perfect for Raspberry Pi, old laptops, embedded systems, personal knowledge bases, and cost-optimized cloud deployments.
